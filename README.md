- Story: Jon just recently moved to the area and hasn't explore much yet. Monday morning, Jon wants to have a cup of coffee and breakfast before his meeting starts, and he quickly checks some cafe around the area. Three Beans Cafe has really high reviews and he wants to try out the online order. Jon also wants to save time and doesn't want to be late for his meeting. He wants to view the menu without needing to sign up for an account. When making an online order, Jon is concerned about how to pick up his order as he has previously had mix ups where other people made online orders with the same name. So he is wondering if the app can provide a better solution then using name to pickup the order.

She has previously had experiences where she browsed the menu and clicked the wrong item and it caused her to order the wrong coffee.
